# PCA

This project uses the Principle Component Analysis(PCA) algorithm to find a low-dimensional representation of face images. It considers a set of 5000 images, applies PCA on them and displays 50 random faces from the database.

To run the project, run the file ex7_pca.m in Octave or Matlab.

The code is written in Matlab but can be run in Octave as well.
